# Mathematical Optimisation of Life-Cycle Assessment Models

General information on the project is contained in the 
[wiki](https://github.com/paulemms/LCA/wiki). This code repository contains two Python
packages and a collection of Jupyter Notebooks. eneral information on the project in the [wiki](https://github.com/paulemms/LCA/wiki).

* The `mola` (Mathematical Optimisation for Life-cycle Assessment) package
contains a collection of Python classes and functions to carry out the optimisation
of life-cycle assessment in a Python script or a Jupyter notebook.

* The `molaqt` package is a QT front-end to the `mola` package. It allows
a user to configure an optimisation problem using a GUI and
then obtain the results using a solver.

* The `notebooks` directory contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that describe
Toy optimisation problems that illustrate the use of the `mola` package.
