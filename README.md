# Mathematical Optimisation of Life-Cycle Assessment Models

## Repository Structure

General information on the project is contained in the 
[wiki](https://github.com/MGuo-Lab/LCA/wiki). There is an 
[Installation Guide](https://github.com/MGuo-Lab/LCA/INSTALL.md) for Windows.

The code repository contains two Python
packages and a collection of Jupyter Notebooks.

* The `mola` (Mathematical Optimisation for Life-cycle Assessment) package
contains a collection of Python classes and functions to carry out the optimisation
of life-cycle assessment in a Python script or a Jupyter notebook.

* The `molaqt` package is a QT front-end to the `mola` package. It allows
a user to configure an optimisation problem using a GUI and
then obtain the results using a solver.

* The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that describe the optimisation model and 
its Python implementation. There are also notebooks containing Toy optimisation problems that demonstrate the use of the
`mola` package. Specific links are provided on the [wiki](https://github.com/MGuo-Lab/LCA/wiki).
