    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Greendata developed [openLCA](www.openlca.org) to provide a set of open source tools for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using a process system model. The tools are written in Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main openLCA client application provides access to a suite of databases that provide the basic building blocks of a model, an interface to construct the model as a system of connected products and flows, and a range of impact methodologies that calculate the impact of the system on the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Greendata also provide a range of [software tools](http://www.openlca.org/openlca/) including a database server called the [collaboration server](http://www.openlca.org/collaboration-server/). The collaboration server provides a centralised source of data with version control. You can freely [download](http://www.openlca.org/download/) the tools to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This note describes how we can use the openLCA databases for optimisation of life cycle models in Python. In order\n",
    "to achieve this task we need to import openLCA data into a Python session and there a number of ways to do this. "

    "## Database Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest option to obtain openLCA data is to read an openLCA database file directly into Python. They can be fairly large compressed files (~1 Gb) which will be larger if loaded into memory. It may not very be efficient to hold all the data in local memory if the database grows by an order of magnitude say.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default format for an openLCA database file is `zolca`, which is a [zipped Derby database](https://ask.openlca.org/811/who-ever-opened-modified-zolca-file-python-possible-thanks). Derby is a relational database system written in Java. The schema for the openLCA database is [here](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-modules/blob/master/olca-core/src/main/resources/org/openlca/core/database/internal/current_schema_derby.sql).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the contents of a `zolca` file using the SQuirreL database client roughly following the instructions [here](https://db.apache.org/derby/integrate/SQuirreL_Derby.html). SQuirreL is written in Java so it makes a JDBC connection to Derby via an embedded driver. A screen shot of the `Processes` table for the file `ecoinvent_36_apos_unit_20191212.zolca` is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![squirrel](Figures/squirrel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the Derby database into Python is not that straightforward. We have not found a Python package that natively reads the Derby database file structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Python package `JayDeBeapi` which pipes commands to a Java JDBC driver. Thus there is a Python dependency on Java with this route to obtain openLCA data. The database `zolca` file has been uncompresssed with 7zip and placed on a linux network drive `\\mnt\\disk1\\` along with the [Derby JDBC drivers](http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.13.1.1.html). Note that double slashes are required by Java in path names if you are using Windows. There must be no spaces in the path. Note also that the driver class name can change with the version of Derby that is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code loads the first 100 rows of the `TBL_PROCESSES` table in `ecoinvent_36_apos_unit_20191212.zolca` into a Python session. The `DESCRIPTION` column needs additional processing."

    "Greendata provide an implementation of an JSON-RPC based protocol for Inter-Process Communication (IPC). It is possible to call openLCA functions in a live session and process results outside of openLCA in Python. The Python session and the openLCA session must be on the same machine. I think the main use of this functionality is to automate the process of building complex models and tasks in the openLCA interface. It also allows you to retreive data from openLCA and perform your own calculations.\n",

We need to show a range of values and networks over which to optimise and it is not clear how one can build a model like this in the current implementation. It would require significant modification to the openLCA user interface and it is not clear that Greendata would want do make these changes.\n",

    "At present, it is proposed that we just use openLCA as a source of data, and our optimisation tool UI allows the building of a model for optimisation. The openLCA database can provide the building blocks for the model. The advantage of using IPC for retrieving data is that it is represented in an object model that can be more easily manipulated in Python.\n",

The `openlca-ipc` Python package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/olca-ipc/) (The Python Package Index), but not for conda it seems.\n",

Also see [this](https://ask.openlca.org/3123/how-create-productsystem-calculation-with-olca-olca-package?show=3123#q3123) which gives some Python code to interact with openLCA.\n",

However, I have had trouble getting ElasticSearch working with a relatively new version of Ubuntu.\n",
